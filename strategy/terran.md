basic rule: one mineral patch per drone,

## 3HL
M&M is crazy strong, you can fight it with mutalisk or block it with lurkers, starting out as a Zerg you don't need mutalisk.

Your opponent can't control your units as well, so why you need to control your muta? if both sides can't control lurkers, lurkers go ahead alot, if you and the enemy can't control mutalisk, the enemy will go ahead.
