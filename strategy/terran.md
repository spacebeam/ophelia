M&M is crazy strong, you can fight it with mutalisk or block it with lurkers, starting out as a Zerg you don't need mutalisk.

Your opponent can't control your units as well, so why you need to control your muta? if both sides can't control lurkers, lurkers go ahead alot, if you and the enemy can't control mutalisk, the enemy will go ahead.

12 hatch, 11 pool, 11 scout drone at the opossite way of the overlord,

your second overlord goes to the entrance of your main natural look up for 8 rax, if you confirm 8rax with the scouting drone you take 8 drones from you main mineral to block, you have to hit the drone pull before the bunker is established, you must monitor with your 1th overlord if Terran is mining gas as response after you pull the 8 drones you must spawn 8 lings exactly.

If the enemy use the environment to shield don't send all units at once, split them half and attack usually no matter how bad you fight 8 lings win over 3 marines and 1 scv, as soon as you block any pressure like this go 2th gas before 3th hatch and drone up.

Normal gas timing is after speed upgrade, speed upgrade and second gas, but game changes because of the 8rax.

Half way to the lair we got den, and start making about 3 groups of lings, spreadling overlords and take a 3th base.

Make 5 o 6 hydras and get ready to morpth them as far as possible from your main, 

if its 2rax academy M&M Push around 6:00, 

6:30 is around when Terran scan if zerg is going muta or not vs old standard 3HM,
