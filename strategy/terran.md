## 3HL
M&M is crazy strong, you can fight it with mutalisk or block it with lurkers, starting out as a Zerg you don't need mutalisk.

Your opponent can't control your units as well, so why you need to control your muta? if both sides can't control lurkers, lurkers go ahead alot, if you and the enemy can't control mutalisk, the enemy will go ahead.

12 hatch, 11 pool, 11 scout drone at the opossite way of the overlord,

your second overlord goes to the entrance of your main natural look up for 8 rax, if you confirm 8rax with the scouting drone you take 8 drones from you main mineral to block, you have to hit the drone pull before the bunker is established, you must monitor with your 1th overlord if Terran is mining gas as response after you pull the 8 drones you must spawn 8 lings exactly.

If the enemy use the environment to shield don't send all units at once, split them half and attack usually no matter how bad you fight 8 lings win over 3 marines and 1 scv, as soon as you block any pressure like this go 2th gas before 3th hatch and drone up.

Normal gas timing is after speed upgrade, speed upgrade and second gas, but game changes because of the 8rax.

Half way to the lair get den, and start making about 3 groups of lings, spread overlords and take a 3th base,

Make 5 o 6 hydras and get ready to morpth them as far as possible from your main, 

if its 2rax academy M&M Push around 6:15, 

6:30 is around when Terran scan if zerg is going muta or not vs old standard 3HM,

keep at least 2 hydras in your base or your 3th and morpth them into defensive lurkers asap,

get queen nest and 1th evolution chamber, you are rushing into hive but while doing this get spire,

in a situation where both sides can micro, it is better for lurkers, just contain the terran, how to control this? just send your lings first and burrow your lurkers, if terran use scan and stims out just pull back, get +1 caparace and hive keep powering since Terran is contained, as you keep powering get your gas at 3th, spread your overlords,

spawn a max number of 12 lurkers for the contain, as soon as you have spire get scourges to snipe vessels and dropships,

get a second evolution chamber, adrenals and ultralisk cavern, 

get nydus canal with hive and sunkens on your bases,

get armor upgrade for ultralisk,

by now you have 1 group of lurkers and scourges defending for dropships,

with your larva just get ultras,

get speed upgrade with ultra, don't mind if the lurker die, they are just for the contain,

focus on getting vessels with your scourge, keep getting ultras, lings and the ocational pair of scourges,

this build order is aiming for 2,1 upgrades check out your evolution chambers.

## 2HM
notes: usually when terran go 8rax they double scout, 

in the past 3HM was very popular but terran now can got fast expand, 2port opener, 1:1:1, or all mech, because of tthat 2HM is standard play now.

2HM can match anything that terran is doing while going mutalisk, this enable Zerg to play acordingly to what they see,

Given those advantages, you can scout and match your oponent more adjusting to what the enemy is doing, lots of routes open for your swarm,

12 hatch, 11 drone scout, 11 pool, 10 gas,

at 2:30 minute mark if you don't notice double scout, or 8rax bunker rush, continue powering and make that 13/17 drone, if 8rax save the larva and defend with 8 drones while spawning 8 lings, 

if by 3:00 there is no CC is a factory base build build, you must build a sunken,

if by 3:30 there is a CC is a factory build, later than that be alert may be fast port,

notes: the sunken in your natural must be build with the 2th drone spawned from that hatchery,

put the spire near the sunken building a wall with your 2th and 3th hatch, sometimes you can complete the wall with hydra den but if the environment don't let you add 6 lings,

notes: learn to wall against speed vulture or die, 

keep powering and get 2th gas at your natural, 

be carefull of the 5:10 terran timing it may be speed vulture preassure, 

notes: your 1th scouting overlord is in the terran natural, he see all type of movement to catch out speed vultures,

at 5:30 you can't rule out a vulture drop yet,

spreed your overlords, and you are going to scout with your first mutas know, you need to confirm whatever it is the enemy's plan with your own eyes,
