## Gas 9
One base fast mutas with 14 speedlings to survive until the first 3 mutas, spawning 5 mutas to one-shot drones before the natural while keep focus on fast +2 carapace upgrade for then a timing attack.

This appear to work best against greed zergs that open with 12 hatch

The build seems like a very nice zerg optimization, 9 overlord, 100 extractor, 9 pool

3 drones at gas a soon as the extractor complete, ling speed, lair and lings non-stop until 17, that translate into 14 lings for attack and defense before our 3 first mutas appear, a simplification of the late stage of this build seems: harass with the first 5th mutas, take the natural, don't die, harass but take care of your muta count wait for the +2 carapace upgrade after making around 24 mutas, split 10 scourges, attack and win.

There are nice timings on this build, for example at 17 zerg buy the 2th overlord and place the spire, start saving larva in the only hatchery for the first 3 mutas, the second hatchery is build only after we got the first 5th mutas, after the natural we continue making mutas but those rally to the natural and stay in the base for defense.

Notes: is very important to keep good visibility with overlords across the maps in the oposite direction of your enemy base.

## 9P
9 Pool is a very flexible build in Zerg versus Zerg, if played properly.

## 12H
This build is greedy and aims to obtain up an early economic advantage with a significantly faster second Hatchery.
