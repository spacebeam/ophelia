## Gas 9
How fast can we have a group and a half of mutas with +2 carapace upgrade and 10 scourges inside the heart of the rival swarm?

This appear to be a nice build against greed zergs that open with 12 hatch

The build seems like a very nice zerg optimization, 9 overlord, 100 extractor, then pool

3 drones at gas a soon as the extractor is complete, ling speed, lair and lings non-stop until 17, that translate into 14 lings for attack and defense before our 3 first mutas appear, a simplification of the late stage of this build seems: harass with the first 5th mutas, take the natural, don't die, harass but take care of your muta count wait for the +2 carapace upgrade after making 18 mutas, 10 split scourges, attack and win.

There are nice timings on this build, for example at 17 you buy the 2th overlord and place the spire, saving later the 3 larva in your only hatchery for the first 3 mutas, the second hatchery is build only after we got the first 5th mutas, after the natural we continue making mutas but those stay in the base for defense.

## 9P
9 Pool is a very flexible build in Zerg versus Zerg, if played properly.

## 12H
This build is greedy and aims to obtain up an early economic advantage with a significantly faster second Hatchery.
