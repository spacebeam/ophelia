## 973!

notes: only drone scout in 4th player maps, place the 1th extractor right after the 3th hatch,

17 supply make hydralisk den!, at your main 16 overlord, and send 2 drones from main to natural,

important note: only make overlords from main hatchery, (since you have already 9 mining drones in main); 
make drones from natural, wanna fast mine? only make drones from the other expansions, where the available spots are.

as soon as the hydralisk den complete, get hydra speed.

24 overlord (in main), at 3th make +1 drone, at 25 you have 19 drones on minerals, 3 mining gas and 6 lings;

still missing the ling timings lol, when we make the first 2 and 4 lings again?

Until here we are ready for the old standard hydra bust, if followed we have a perfect 973;
9 drones on main, 7 on natural and 3 on 3th, plus 3 drones on gas at natural and 6 lings guarding protoss base entrance.


## 973(4)

notes: after overpool if protoss scout you first < 2 minute mark, you must go zerglings.

11 drone scout, 12 natural, 2th hatch,

11 3th hatch at new expansion,

if they scout you first < 2 minute mark, spawn 6 lings,

after the 3th hatch, create 1th gas extractor at main,

with the first 50 gas build a hydralisk den,

notes: following this playstyle don't waste the first lings trying to get them inside protoss main.

as soon as the hydralisk den is done get speed, and move your focus to powering,

if fast adun be aware of where is the first zealot.

notes: early timing window of 6, 7 hydras to preassure against adun first, you MUST break the forge.

notes: 6,7 hydras 6 put preassure the 7th stay back home defending of any early corsair play.

keep powering, get 5th hach and lair, after hydra speed complete get range,

make sure you position the hydras in a way that after range is complete they start to attack the forge,

after preassure and dealing hopefully with the forge get zergling speed,

preassure attack with the first 12 hydras and initial 6 lings,

preasure and pull back, after 5th hatch get 1th evolution chamber and keep powering,

sacrifice a scouting overlord, and make overlords starting now only on the natural,

send the damage hydras from initial preassure back to defend from any late corsair attack,

if they attack or put preassure defend with sunken at each base and lings, mix hydra lings and a move,

scout its main with overlords if fast gates start making hydras after 5th hatch,

scout notes: the overlord inside the enemy base needs to scout the amount of gateways and the robotics timing.

if there is templar archives, start making hydras after 6th hatch,

if lurker play, get lurker and overlord speed if not get spire after lair,

if no stargate put overlords around, keep powering, get sunkens and 5 hatch asap,

after lair, put spire and 2th gas extractor at the natural,

if anything happens defend with lings and sunkens...

counter attack with lings and hydras put preassure after defend if anything happens,

after spair get 5 mutalisk, lurker upgrade and evolution chamber

get overlord speed and overlords scouting all around the map,

get 4th expansion on the other side of the map,

after 5 mutalisk, keep powering, get more hatcheries, soon the lurker upgrade will be done, get overlord speed,

check with mutas if enemy have a 3th base, if so start powering the 4th expansion, if not keep getting hydras,

block any DT incursion, and be prepare for drops,

keep powering, 2 more hatcheries in 4th asap, get 2th evolution chamber,

get natural in the 4th base, prepare to backstab with 3 groups of lings and hydra,

get hive, keep upgrades and powering in the last expansions, if you follow 9734 by now you have powerful magic,

greed notes: just keep one base ahead at all times, usually even if you have 2 more one of those is a trap.

upgrade notes: get second range attack upgrade and 2th evolution chamber,

hive notes: upgrade only after having 2 working evolution chambers,

don't put the 5th expansion until 1, you are sure your enemy is getting its 4th, and 2, you have dark swarm.

after hive get addrenals and 3th evolution chamber,

defense notes: on high ground is nice to usually put 3 sunkens.

notes ling/lurker swich: after getting defiler all gas goes into lurkers.

End of 9734 analysis.
